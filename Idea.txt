Term project Idea:

Create a Smart contract that manages employees at work.  The scope of this is to address inconsitencies within the store and make the actions of the employees
visible to the manager.  Often stores suffer from employees not doing there job correctly, i.e. incorrect register count, overuse of employee discounts

Smart contract that is responsible for PoS improvments:
	
	Time approvals - Clock in/out
	Paying the staff at the timely intervals
	Managing employee discounts

	*Manages inventory on a consistent basis based upon transactions 2
	*Allows the customer to pay with Crypto for their purchases 1
	Also allows the customer to pay with Cash, credit cards, and Ram Cash
	Prevents employees stealing/incorrect change to the customer	
	
	Transactions could be mined by Proof of Stake of the employee managing the register
		* If the employee performs invalid transactions ---------------------------

	Prevents only approved employees to work at a time based upon the schedule created by an approved manager
	Ensures responsibility for workers, if they swap shifts, these are approved by the manager.
	

	Blockchain on supplyChain, PoS system
