Point of Sale

	Maintains three databases that contain:
	*Product information
	*Records of the purchases
	*Inventory

Using blockchain technology with PoS:
	
	Transaction details are save to the blockchain
		*This will have all the records publicly available, helping out with tax audits
		*The smart contract could perform appropriate budgeting for the store allowing automation for getting the register reports at the end of the day

Revised Idea:

The benefits of using blockchain are easily shown in this system, the main issue is that the crypto currency is volatile and doesn't always hold its value.
Ramcash holds a dollar value and is backed up by the university since students can pay money to get ramcash.  Lets make Ramcash a cryptocurrency that is used at all of the stores on campus.
One RamCoin could be worth $1.

Since the university operates with "RamCoin" we can re-create the PoS system to do the following:
	*Allow students to make purchases around campus
	*The Registers can maintain the inventory for the stores
	*keep the records of the students purchases
	*allow the university to see where the students money is being spent
	

The benifit of using RamCoin exclusively is that the university will always have the money
