Point of Sale

	Maintains three databases that contain:
	*Product information
	*Records of the purchases
	*Inventory

Using blockchain technology with PoS:
	
	Transaction details are save to the blockchain
		*This will have all the records publicly available, helping out with tax audits
		*The smart contract could perform appropriate budgeting for the store allowing automation for getting the register reports at the end of the day

Revised Idea:

The benefits of using blockchain are easily shown in this system, the main issue is that the crypto currency is volatile and doesn't always hold its value.
Ramcash holds a dollar value and is backed up by the university since students can pay money to get ramcash.  Lets make Ramcash a cryptocurrency that is used at all of the stores on campus.
One RamCoin could be worth $1.

Since the university operates with "RamCoin" we can re-create the PoS system to do the following:
	*Allow students to make purchases around campus
	*The Registers can maintain the inventory for the stores
	*keep the records of the students purchases
	*allow the university to see where the students money is being spent
	

Hopefully this will make more sense.

Each of the vendors will be a registered address with the RamCoin System.
	*The vendors will have to have a wallet associated with the store so that the vendor could perform transactions, pay the gas
The vendor registers with the contract and creates an instance of the register along with some of the products that they sell.
	*This could be another smart contract deployed within the contract for RamCoin
	*If the vendor only accepts RamCoin then the application of this will always allow the state of the register to be at the correct balance
		**This is the crucial part of this system
The student makes a purchase with their account giving the vendor their RamCoin based upon their address with the system
	*The register will create the transaction and record the type of sale done
		** This will document what was purchased, the sales amount
		** These things could be batched and at the end of the day the register would then modify the current state of the inventory
		** While these would still be purchased in RamCoin the register report could still translate this to a dollar value that the university has
